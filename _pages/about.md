I am currently a Research Fellow at The University of Melbourne under the supervision of <a href="https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/474-girish-nair"> Professor Girish Nair</a>.
I concluded my PhD studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) under the supervision of <a href="http://liberzon.csl.illinois.edu/">Professor Daniel Liberzon</a>  on control and estimation with finite data-rate in 2023. 

My research interests are:
 - Control and estimation with finite data-rate
 - Information theory
 - Dynamical systems and chaos
 - Stochastic dynamics
 - Hybrid systems
 - Nonlinear estimation and control

Some applications of these topics that interest me are
 - Quantized control and estimation
 - Fundamental limitations on machine learning algorithms 
 - Numerical methods
 - Signal processing with data-rate limitations
 - Control and estimation over communication networks
