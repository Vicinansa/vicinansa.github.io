I’m a fifth year PhD student at UIUC under <a href="http://liberzon.csl.illinois.edu/">Professor Daniel Liberzon</a>  working on control and estimation with finite data-rate. Previously, I worked with <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=bHfxlykAAAAJ&hl=en">Professor Paulo Sérgio Pereira da Silva</a> on differential algebraic methods in control and estimation.

My research interests are:
 - dynamical systems
 - switched and hybrid systems
 - nonlinear estimation and control
 - control and estimation with finite data-rate
 - differential algebraic methods in estimation and control
 - control of quantum systems

Some applications of these topics are
 - robotics
 - numerical methods
 - signal processing
 - control over communication networks
 - quantum technologies
